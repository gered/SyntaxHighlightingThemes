You must create a `RailsCasts` theme inside CLion first. Do this in Settings > Editor > Colors & Fonts,
select any existing scheme and click "Save As" and name the new scheme `RailsCasts`

Close CLion, then go to `~/Library/Preferences/clion10/colors` and there should be a `RailsCasts.icls` file
which can be replaced with this one.

#### Note:

This theme is basically just a copy of the IntelliJ theme which was imported into CLion and then the
C/C++ colors customized where needed.
