You must create a `RailsCasts` theme inside IntelliJ first. Do this in Settings > Editor > Colors & Fonts,
select any existing scheme and click "Save As" and name the new scheme `RailsCasts`

Close IntelliJ, then go to `~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea12/colors` and there should be a `RailsCasts.icls` file
which can be replaced with this one.
