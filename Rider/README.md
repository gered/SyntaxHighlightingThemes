Import this file into Rider under Settings > Editor > Color Scheme, and then use the "Import Scheme" function.

#### Note:

This theme is basically just a copy of the IntelliJ theme which was imported into Rider and then the
C# colors (and maybe some other language colors too) customized where needed.
