NOTE: There has been a bug in Xcode for years now where bold font styling doesn't get applied
      very often. Sometimes, you can trigger some kind of "refresh" where all the different
      font styling gets applied properly and you'll see the function name bolding in this
      theme, but the majority of the time it's not there. Unfortunate, but nothing I can do.
